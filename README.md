# Programming and Scripting Problems 2020 - Eoin Lees

The following is a selection of weekly problems assigned for the module Program and Scripting. 

## Getting Started

Download the files to your local drive and use the command promt to cd into the folder. 
Run each program with the python command. All programs should run as is. Week 7 problem requires the use of the moby-dick.txt file provided. 

### Prerequisites

You need to have python installed on your computer in order to run the programs. 

## Running the programs

The following programs are all run by python using the cmd prompt in the project folder. 

### Week 2 Problem - bmi.py

To use this program you need to input your weight in kgs and height in cms. It then calculates your BMI based on these figures. 
It also assigns a classification to your BMI based on the WHO's classifications. Note: BMI has been proven to be a very basic method for testing fitness/healthiness.
It is an example of using python to do calculations and return them in a statement in a presentable fashion. 

### Week 3 Problem - secondstring.py

To use this program  you input a string from the command promt. It then returns it printed with every second letter in reverse order. 
It is an example of using python to manupulate variables it recieves and present it back in any format needed. 

### Week 4 Problem - collatz.py

To use this program you enter any positive integer. It will not run if you enter a negative number or float.
It returns a list of values based on if the number is even or odd as described in the code. 
It is an example of making statements conditional and making the program make decisions. 

### Week 5 Problem - weekday.py

To use this program you simply run it in python on the command prompt. 
It returns a statement based on the day of the week it is run. It also returns a conditional statement that differs for weekdays and weekends. 
It is an example of importing python modules and using the list/tuple ability of python. It combines the data recieved from the date time module with the title assigned to each number in the list to print a readable discription of the day of the week. It also is an example of using the if statement.   

### Week 6 Problem - squareroot.py

To use this program you enter a positive floating point number into the input. It will approximate the square root of this number using the newton method. 
It is an example of using functions in python and calling them for use. It also required research into the mathematical method for calculating square roots. 

### Week 7 Problem - es.py

To use this program you need to run the following command in python: "python es.py moby-dick.txt" 
It will return a statement of the number of the letter e in the document supplied. It will run with any .txt document in place of the moby-dick.txt. 
It is an example of reading from a file and getting an imput directly from the command line. It uses the sys module to achieve this. It also is an example of using except to block any errors in the code and print instruction if errors are made.   
Note: moby-dick.txt file included in repository for quick testing. 

### Week 8 Problem - plot.py

To use this program you simply run it in python. It will directly print a plot of the formula described in the code. 
It is an example of using the numpy and matplotlib modules in python. 
The numpy module allows you to manipulate the data from the function provided in order for them to be more readable on teh plot. 
The matplotlib module takes the data and presents it in the plot. It allows you to correctly label, colour and present the data in graphical format.
